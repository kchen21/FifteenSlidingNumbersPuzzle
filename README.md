Fifteen Sliding Numbers Puzzle is a re-creation of an original game called 15 Puzzle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). It uses jQuery to manipulate the DOM, creating a simple, intuitive UI.

## Rules

Your goal is to rearrange the numbers in order from least to greatest.

Click on a numbered square next to the empty, white spot to move it into that spot.

**Good Luck!**
