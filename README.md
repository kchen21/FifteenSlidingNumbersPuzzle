Fifteen Sliding Numbers Puzzle is a re-creation of an original game called 15 Puzzle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). It uses jQuery to manipulate the DOM, creating a simple, intuitive UI.

## Rules

Your goal is to rearrange the numbers in order from least to greatest.

You can only move a numbered square into a spot if that spot is empty.

Click on a numbered square to attempt to move it. If there is an empty spot adjacent to it, it will move to that spot. Otherwise, nothing will happen.

**Good Luck!**
